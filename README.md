# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone

**Professional Self-Assessment:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my time in the capstone course, I have learned a great deal. Revisiting and improving past work has been beneficial not only to my development skills but also to my personal growth. Recognizing failures and mistakes enables growth. When tasked with building upon something previously created, it opened my mind to solving the same issue better by using past experiences as a guide. This is vital in the computer science field. Knowing there are multiple approaches to a problem can inspire self-improvement. We learned many vital skills, such as how to interact and communicate with stakeholders and investors. Gaining their views and input on project ideas is crucial since projects are often created for them. This improves user experience and enhances team communication and project goals. Other topics covered included software development and design, data structures and algorithms, and databases. These vital computer science topics were continuously built upon to become better, well-rounded developers capable of improving any project we undertake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current ePortfolio comprises three different assignments encompassing these topics. For the software engineering and design portion, I used a project where we created Python scripts that interact with a MongoDB database to retrieve information for an animal shelter company. I updated the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) methodologies within the code to make it more scalable and user-friendly. The second project, focused on data structures and algorithms, involved creating a system to parse and connect information from a class list in a text file. The updates included optimizing the algorithm for faster processing and adding a user interface for better interaction. Finally, for databases, I enhanced the MongoDB database interaction on a webpage, allowing users to retrieve more detailed information about available dogs, including similar suggestions.

**Software Engineering & Design:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artifact Iâ€™ll discuss is a web application that interacts with a MongoDB database and a .csv file to return information for users. It was an assignment for CS-340 Client/Server Development, focusing on Python, Jupyter Notebook, MongoDB, Linux, and web development processes. Designed for an animal shelter, it allows employees or visitors to filter through the company's database to find specific breeds and types of animals. The web application returns requested information and the animal's location on a Google map. It was created earlier this year as part of an assignment at SNHU.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose this application because it targets multiple assignment categories and is one of my proudest projects at SNHU due to its scale and complexity. The implementation of CRUD principles showcases software engineering and design principles well. Initially imperfect, I revised the project to clearly label and streamline the create, read, update, and delete sections within the Python module, making the code more concise and easier to read.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I achieved the desired course outcomes. The main objective was to improve an existing project related to software design and development. Enhancing the CRUD attributes within the Python code improved the project's overall efficiency. CRUD formatting is a common industry-standard method essential for maintainable code or software.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a lot from improving this artifact. I had to replicate the Apporto environment on my computer and use tools like MongoDB Compass to test changes without launching the entire program. Through trial and error, I successfully implemented the CRUD module and improved the project's functionality.

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chosen artifact is a C++ program that parses a text file and returns information based on user requests. The text file contains course information and prerequisites. Users can request the entire list or specific course details. Created in December 2023 for a Data Structures and Algorithms course at SNHU, this artifact fits the assignment requirements perfectly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original code used a switch-case function, which I replaced with an unordered map for better functionality and usability. The initial artifact had runtime errors, which I fixed, resulting in a more efficient and error-free system. These improvements demonstrate my growth in data structures and algorithms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I met the course objectives by enhancing the data structure for a functional, error-free system. My improvement plan included fixing the database and improving the software engineering and design portions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a lot about data structures. There are many methods to achieve the same result, so I sought a unique solution. One challenge was setting up my C++ environment on a new computer, requiring reinstalling and configuring necessary tools.

**Databases:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artifact I chose is a database created and accessed using MongoDB for CS-340 Client/Server Development. It handles inputs and outputs for a database used by an animal shelter company, created in January this year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This artifact meets the database improvement requirements. It accesses a database populated by a .csv file and returns requested information. I added a search bar for user inputs and correlated outputs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I met the course objectives but will make further updates before the final submission of module seven.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up a virtual environment was challenging, especially on my MacBook. This project requires MongoDB and the necessary components for proper functionality, which I successfully configured.

**The course outcomes expected of us as students are listed below. Throughout this course, we were tasked with meeting these expectations through various projects and assignments. In one way or another, we addressed each component during our improvement and development processes for each project. By continuously refining our work and applying new knowledge, we ensured that each outcome was effectively met.**

- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data      structures and algorithms)
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software         engineering/design/database)
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
